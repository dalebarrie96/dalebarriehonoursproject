Once the code is downloaded to run the application follow these simple steps (Node.js must be installed on the machine):
1.	Open the project folders root directory on command prompt.
2.	Once in the correct directory type “npm install”.*
3.	To run the app in developer mode type “nodemon app.js”.**
4.	To run the app normally type “node app.js”.
Some text should be printed to the terminal and when the line “listening on *:3000” is printed the application is running and waiting for clients to join.
*This stage is necessary to install all the required Node.js Packages that this application requires to run. A “package.json” file was included so this could be achieved through one command line. 
**Developer mode allows the server to automatically update should any changes be made to the code.
